To create a Data URI from an HTML file, you can follow these steps:

1.  Encode the content of the HTML file using Base64 encoding. You can use an online tool or here's an example using Python:
```
import base64

with open('path/to/your/file.html', 'rb') as file:
    html_content = file.read()

encoded_content = base64.b64encode(html_content).decode('utf-8')
print(encoded_content)
```

2.  Construct the Data URI by combining the MIME type, the Base64-encoded content, and the appropriate prefix. For an HTML file, the MIME type is "text/html". The Data URI format is as follows:
```
data:[MIME-type];base64,[encoded-content]
```
So, in this case, the Data URI would be:

```
data:text/html;base64,[encoded-content]
```
Replace `[encoded-content]` with the `encoded_content` obtained from the previous step.

3.  Now, you can use the Data URI within your HTML code or save it to a file as needed.
